# Test Automation Folder Structure

## /src/test/java/tests/

- contract/
  Contains API Contract tests.
  These validate that API responses match the defined JSON Schemas.

- functional/
  Contains Functional tests.

  Aspect	Functional Testing Checks
  Valid Inputs	Returns correct success response
  Invalid Inputs	Returns correct error response
  Boundaries	Works at limits, rejects out-of-range
  Field Rules	Required enforced, optional handled
  Idempotency	Same request â†’ same result
  Full Workflow	Data flows correctly across multiple APIs

  These verify the behavior of APIs interacting with other services or modules.

- performance/
  Contains performance or load test scripts (if any).

- utils/
  Contains reusable helper classes, test data builders, request/response parsers, and config utilities.
